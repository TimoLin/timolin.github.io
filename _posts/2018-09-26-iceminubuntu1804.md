At August, I upgraded my UBUNTU 16.04 to 18.04. This version is great.  
However, I met a problem when starting ICEMCFD 18.0 and 19.0.  
I check the start script file of icemcfd at "ansys_inc/v191/icemcfd/linux64_amd/bin". There are two solutions: 
## Solution 1
If you don't want to change the icemcfd start script, just run the following command:  
```shell
icemcfd -log tmp.log
```
-log is a icemcfd argument, tmp.log is the log file generated at your pwd.
======
## Solution 2
If you use other argument when you start icemcfd, the following solution may be not very good. (I don't use arguments when start icemcfd, so it works well for me)
First- cd to your icemcfd bin dir:
```shell
cd /usr/ansys_inc/v191/icemcfd/linux64_amd/bin
```
Then: edit the icemcfd shell script by any text editor you want, here we use gvim:
```shell
gvim icemcfd
```
change line 607:
from 
`eval "$ICEM_ACN/bin/med" "$args"` 
to
`"$ICEM_ACN/bin/med" $args` or `$ICEM_ACN/bin/med`
